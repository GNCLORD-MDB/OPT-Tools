# OPT-Tools

These set of tools allows building and hosting of several OPT mods.

## Components

**settings**  
In this folder, a file named `setMetaData.bat` has to exist (An example is included). Copy the example and adjust your local filepaths.
`serverConfig.cfg` is used for a local ArmA-DevServer. Do not edit the mission-name, because it's changed automatically.

**tools**  
These scripts can directly be executed by the user or his IDE. Each filename describes the task.
To automatically close the scripts after execution, execute them with a "noPause" parameter or adjust the `WaitAtFinish` setting in `setMetaData.bat`.

**helpers**  
Here resides some internal helping tools or scripts. You don't need them directly. Just ignore.
